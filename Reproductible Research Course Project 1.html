## Including Plots

```{r}
library("ggplot2")
file <- read.csv("activity.csv")
file$date <- as.POSIXct(file$date, "%Y-%m-%d")
weekdays <- weekdays(fie$date)
file <- cbind(file, weekdays)
summary(file)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r}
total_steps <- with(file, aggregate(steps, by = list(date), FUN = sum, na.rm = TRUE))
names(total_steps) <- c("date", "steps")
hist(total_steps$steps, main = "Total number of steps taken per day", xlab = "Total number of steps taken per day", 
     col = "darkblue", ylim = c(0, 20), breaks = seq(0, 25000))

mean(total_steps$steps)
median(total_steps$steps)
```

## mean = 9354.23
## median = 10395

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r}
average_activity <- aggregate(file$steps, by = list(file$interval), FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)
names(average_activity) <- c("interval", "mean")
plot(average_activity$interval, average_activity$mean, type = "l", col = "darkblue", lwd = 2,
     xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Average number of steps", main = "Average number of steps per intervals")

average_activity[which.max(average_activity$mean), ]$interval
```

## 835


##Imputing missing values

```{r}
sum(is.na(activity$steps))
```

## na = 2304

```{r}
imputed_steps <- average_activity$mean[match(file$interval, average_activity$interval)]

activity_imputed <- transform(file, steps = ifelse(is.na(file$steps), yes = imputed_steps, no = file$steps))
total_steps_imputed <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activity_imputed, sum)
names(total_steps_imputed) <- c("date", "daily_steps")

hist(total_steps_imputed$daily_steps, col = "darkblue", xlab = "Total steps per day", ylim = c(0,30), 
     main = "Total number of steps taken each day", breaks = seq(0,25000,by=2500))

mean(total_steps_imputed$daily_steps)
median(total_steps_imputed$daily_steps)

```

## mean = 10766.19
## median = 10766.19

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

```{r}
file$date <- as.Date(strptime(file$date, format="%Y-%m-%d"))
file$datetype <- sapply(file$date, function(x) {
    if (weekdays(x) == "saturday" | weekdays(x) =="sunday") 
    {y <- "Weekend"} else 
    {y <- "Weekday"}
    y
})

activity_by_date <- aggregate(steps~interval + datetype, file, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
plot<- ggplot(activity_by_date, aes(x = interval , y = steps, color = datetype)) +
    geom_line() +
    labs(title = "Average daily steps by type of date", x = "Interval", y = "Average number of steps") +
    facet_wrap(~datetype, ncol = 1, nrow=2)
print(plot)
```

## yes, there are
